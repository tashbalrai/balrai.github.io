#### Welcome viewer, 
This website is the collection of notes that I created while reading or studying few of my favorite topics about web, computer science, and programming and of course other stuff that interests me which may or may not be related to computers directly or indirectly. This project is an effort to share information that I consider may be helpful in some ways to other guys struggling with the topics. I have tried to structure the information into collection of topics for easy to learners and have tried to keep the topics as concise as possible so that readers don't have to read the stories. Following are the few of the topics that I have tried to cover up.

#### JavaScript, PHP, Python, HTTP, Laravel, CodeIgniter
