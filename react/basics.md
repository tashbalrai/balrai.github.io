## Setup New React App
Install the create-react-app application to create the basic application structure.

```npm
npm install -g --save-dev create-react-app
create-react-app my-app
```

## Manual Installation (Advanced)
Have a package manager either Yarn or npm. We will proceed with npm.

```
npm init
npm install --save react react-dom
```

```npm init``` will initialize the package manager and will create a package.json file. Then we install react and react-dom packages and save them into package.json file as dependencies.

For compatibility purposes, all react packages should be of same version.

## Setting Up Transpiler (Babel)
Setup babel to support ES6 and JSX.
