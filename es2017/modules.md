## Modules
Before modules, all JavaScript were run into a single scope called global scope. Modules provide us a mechanism to package the related code and bound them to local scopes.

## Exporting Modules
You can export the bindings in the module so that they become visible to the outside world. Otherwise function, classes, variables etc. are only scoped to its containing module only.

### Basic Export
In the bare minimum you can export any function, variable, class etc by just prefixing ```export``` keyword to it.

```javascript

```
